Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Social Sciences at California Institute of Technology with research interests in American Politics and Political Methodology. More specifically, I am focused on political behavior such as turnout and campaign contributions, working with large voter registration datasets Federal Election Commission datasets. I mainly use R and Stan to employ tools such as probabilistic record linkage, geocomputation, and Bayesian statistics.
