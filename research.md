#### Getting Settled in Your New Home: The Costs of Moving on Voter Turnout <br/> (job market paper)

Moving can theoretically depress turnout in several ways by imposing social, informational, and convenience costs on the voter. However, movers eventually settle, and such detrimental effects can disappear over time. What are the longitudinal impacts of the said costs, and how can we boost movers' turnout? Using a general additive model, I show how residential mobility affects voters over time using detailed voter panel data from Orange County, California, augmented with change-of-address data from the United States Postal Service. I find that each cost disproportionately disenfranchises voters who move close to the election, while there is no strong evidence for a pure distraction cost. I also evaluate a policy aimed to retain movers, rooted in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. I find that safety nets in the form of proactive outreaches---or nudge mailings---successfully help movers turn out.

#### [Evaluating the Quality of Changes in Voter Registration Databases](http://vote.caltech.edu/working-papers/134) <br/> (with Spencer Schneider and R. Michael Alvarez)

The administration of elections depends crucially upon the quality and integrity of voter registration databases. In addition, political scientists are increasingly using these databases in their research. However, these databases are dynamic, and may be subject to external manipulation and unintentional errors. In this paper, using data from Orange County, California, we develop two methods for evaluating the quality of voter registration data as it changes over time: (1) generating audit data by repeated record linkage across periodic snapshots of a given database, and monitoring it for sudden anomalous changes; and (2) identifying duplicates via an efficient, automated duplicate detection, and tracking new duplicates and deduplication efforts over time. We show that the generated data can serve not only to evaluate voter file quality and election integrity, but also as a novel source of data on election administration practices.
