#### [Evaluating the Quality of Changes in Voter Registration Databases](http://vote.caltech.edu/working-papers/134) (with Spencer Schneider and R. Michael Alvarez)

The administration of elections depends crucially upon the quality and integrity of voter registration databases. In addition, political scientists are increasingly using these databases in their research. However, these databases are dynamic, and may be subject to external manipulation and unintentional errors. In this paper, using data from Orange County, California, we develop two methods for evaluating the quality of voter registration data as it changes over time: (1) generating audit data by repeated record linkage across periodic snapshots of a given database, and monitoring it for sudden anomalous changes; and (2) identifying duplicates via an efficient, automated duplicate detection, and tracking new duplicates and deduplication efforts over time. We show that the generated data can serve not only to evaluate voter file quality and election integrity, but also as a novel source of data on election administration practices.
